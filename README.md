# Satisfactory Viewer

This is a very quickly thrown together application to serve satisfactory save files to be able to load them into the
save viewer that's part of satisfactory-calculator.com.

It is written in Go purely because I fancied learning the language - It'll be full of Golang _faux pas_, but this is not
a serious app, and I don't consider my satisfactory games to be confidential.

Having said that, I'm more than willing to improve my craft, so feel free to comment or advise :)
